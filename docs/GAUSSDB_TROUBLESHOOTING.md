# GaussDB Connection Troubleshooting

## Current Issue
‚úÖ Configuration loaded successfully  
‚úÖ GaussDB service initialized  
‚ùå **Connection timeout** - Cannot reach the database

## Root Cause
The endpoint `192.168.0.136:5432` is a **private IP address**. This means:
- It's only accessible within the Huawei Cloud VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Your local machine cannot reach it directly

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Elastic IP (EIP) - Recommended for Development
This allows direct connection from your local machine.

1. **Bind an EIP to your GaussDB instance**:
   - Go to Huawei Cloud Console ‚Üí GaussDB ‚Üí Your Instance
   - Click "Bind EIP" or "Public Network Access"
   - Allocate/Select an EIP
   - Wait for binding to complete

2. **Update Security Group**:
   - Go to "Security Groups" in the console
   - Find the security group for your GaussDB instance
   - Add an **Inbound Rule**:
     - Protocol: TCP
     - Port: 5432
     - Source: Your IP (or 0.0.0.0/0 for testing - **not secure for production!**)

3. **Update `.env` file**:
   ```env
   HUAWEI_GAUSSDB_ENDPOINT=<YOUR_EIP>:5432
   ```
   Example: `HUAWEI_GAUSSDB_ENDPOINT=123.45.67.89:5432`

4. **Test again**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/test-gaussdb.ts
   ```

### Option 2: Deploy Application to Huawei Cloud
For production, deploy your Next.js app to:
- **CCE (Cloud Container Engine)** - Kubernetes
- **CCI (Cloud Container Instance)** - Serverless containers
- **ECS (Elastic Cloud Server)** - Virtual machine

When your app runs inside Huawei Cloud VPC, it can access the private IP `192.168.0.136`.

### Option 3: VPN or Direct Connect
Set up a VPN connection to your Huawei Cloud VPC (more complex, for enterprise).

## Quick Check Commands

### 1. Test network connectivity:
```bash
# Windows
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 192.168.0.136 -Port 5432

# Or use telnet
telnet 192.168.0.136 5432
```

If this fails, it confirms the IP is not reachable from your machine.

### 2. Verify GaussDB is running:
In Huawei Cloud Console:
- Check instance status is "Available"
- Verify port is 5432
- Check security group rules

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Configuration: Correct
- ‚úÖ Service: Initialized
- ‚úÖ Credentials: Valid format
- ‚ùå **Network: Cannot reach database**

## Next Steps
1. Get the **EIP (public IP)** of your GaussDB instance or bind one
2. Update security group to allow port 5432 from your IP
3. Update `HUAWEI_GAUSSDB_ENDPOINT` in `.env` with the public IP
4. Run test again

## For Demo/Competition
If you can't get direct connectivity now, you have two paths:

### Path A: Use EIP for Testing
- Bind EIP ‚Üí Update .env ‚Üí Test locally
- This lets you develop and test everything on your machine
- Remember to unbind EIP or restrict security groups before production!

### Path B: Mock GaussDB for Now
- We can create a mock/fallback mode that uses in-memory storage
- Continue development of other features
- Set up real GaussDB connection later when deploying to cloud

Let me know which path you want to take! üöÄ
